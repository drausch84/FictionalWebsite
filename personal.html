                If you're reading this,&nbsp;you've obviously found an interest in me and want to know more about my life!<br>
                While there are some secrets to be kept,&nbsp;I can tell you that I am a huge pizza aficionado,&nbsp;pepperoni FTW!<br>
                My favorite movies have changed over the years,&nbsp;but I can say that lately I've been watching a lot of Scarface and The Godfather.<br>
                After a hard day's work,&nbsp;I like to relax with a good single-malt scotch (neat of course) and a book of Walt Whitman poetry.<br>
                My dislikes include people who don't pay money up front,&nbsp;doorbells (I prefer to knock!),&nbsp;the DEA,&nbsp;and boxer shorts.
