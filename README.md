# FictionalWebsite
**Technologies Used** 
- HTML, CSS 
  
## About the Project 
This is a basic website project for CS336: Web and Database Applications.  The project itself was meant for basic HTML but I added a CSS file to spruce the whole thing up. 
The assignment involved making a personal website for a fictional character.  I chose to go with Heisenberg himself, Walter White!
