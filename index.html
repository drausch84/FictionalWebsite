                Hello, my name is Walter Hartwell White Sr.,&nbsp;but lately I prefer,&nbsp;"Heisenberg".&nbsp;I am a former chemist turned high school chemistry teacher.<br>
                Chemistry has always fascinated me,&nbsp;I like to think of it as the study of change.&nbsp;And change has certainly applied for me lately!<br>
                I've always considered myself a bit of a self-starter.&nbsp;As I always say,&nbsp;"there's no such thing as half-measures,&nbsp;but tread lightly"!<br>
                Aside from being a genius chemist who was hustled out of billions by his former business partners...sorry for rambling there!<br>
                Anyways, I am a devoted husband to my beautiful wife,&nbsp;Skylar,&nbsp;as well as a devoted father to my children,&nbsp;Walter Jr. and Holly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately,&nbsp;on my 50th birthday,&nbsp;I fainted at my thankless side-job working at a car-wash for a deranged Armenian man,&nbsp;Bogdon Wolynetz.<br>
                Arriving by ambulance at the nearest hospital,&nbsp;I was diagnosed with Stage 3 lung cancer.&nbsp;It was a tough reality to face,&nbsp;especially for my family.<br>
                I felt hopeless,&nbsp;until my DEA brother-in-law,&nbsp;Hank,&nbsp;took me on a ride-along to bust a meth lab and I discovered a solution to my problems!<br>
                With the help of one of my former students,&nbsp;Jesse Pinkman,&nbsp;the streets of Albuquerque were about to be flooded with a beautiful shade of "Sky Blue".<br>
                Out of fear of being caught,&nbsp;I can't divulge anymore!&nbsp;However,&nbsp;you can always find out more about me from my critically acclaimed television show,&nbsp;"Breaking Bad"!
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            To My Family:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <i>My name is Walter Hartwell White.&nbsp;I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,&nbsp;Albuquerque,&nbsp;New Mexico,&nbsp;87104.&nbsp;To all law enforcement entities,&nbsp; this is not an admission of guilt.<br>
                I am speaking to my family now.&nbsp; Skyler,&nbsp;you are the love of my life.&nbsp;I hope you know that.&nbsp;Walter Jr.,&nbsp; you’re my big man.&nbsp;There are going to be some things that you’ll come<br>
                to learn about me in the next few days.&nbsp;But just know that no matter how it may look,&nbsp; I only had you in my heart.&nbsp; Goodbye.</i>
